I am a **Data Scientist** studying the impacts of natural processes and human activities on **air quality**, **food security**, **environmental health**, and **climate change**, using **process-based models**, such as:

* **Community Earth System Model** ([CESM](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/)) for modeling soil ammonia emission, and marine sulfur aerosols;
* **[GEOS-Chem](http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/geos/)** to estimate aerosol pollution driven by agricultural ammonia emissions, and;
* **DeNitrification-DeComposition** ([DNDC](http://www.dndc.sr.unh.edu/)) to model crop yields of maize-soybean intercropping.

I graduated with a Ph.D. from [Prof. Amos Tai's group](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/sci/essc/tgabi/) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong ([CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html)) in 2019. Then, I worked with [Prof. Colette Heald's group](https://www.healdgroupmit.com/) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology ([MIT](https://mit.edu)) as a Postdoctoral Associate until 2021.

I use my Cantonese name ["Ka Ming Fung"](/post/2019-09-03-about-ka-ming/) for my academic publications, though I am also known as Victor.
